# Simple Linear Regression in Python from scratch

### First we plot our data - YearsExperience vs Salary as a scatterplot : 
<img src = "../SimpleLinearRegression/images/fit_through_traindata">

### Next we train out models and plot a simple line through both the test data and train data
#### Train Data :
<img src = "./images/fit_through_traindata">
#### Test Data :
<img src = "./images/fit_through_testdata">

And that's it :)
